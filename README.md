# roomba-bot

##
`roomba-bot` is based on Termux, WA Web. Allowing simple integration between WA groups or P2P messaging between users and the bot for getting automated messages.

I use it to manage my personal things, check things like DNS, News, Post items, and other group activities. Roomba-bot has a plugin based architecture that allows easy integration of new plugins.  I'm not super happy with this, but if Termux proves itself as a stable workaround for WA security, i'll refactor it too making it more generic.

For now, it's for personal use only and education purposes only. Feel free to fork and play with it too.
