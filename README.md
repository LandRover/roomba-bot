# roomba-bot

## :warning: Warning :warning:
Unfortunately, due to recent updates in whatsapp servers, bots are beeing banned real quickly. My new numbers were banned within minutes.
Since WhatsApp is a closed protocol, yowsup is responsible for the reverse engineering to understand the messages exchange from whatsapp server.
If a new protocol will pop, project will return. Until then, sadly, the project will be on hold. Use on your own risk.
